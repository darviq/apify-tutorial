Do you have to rebuild an actor each time the source code is changed?
Yes, the source code manager on Apify platform prompts this with every change.

What is the difference between pushing your code changes and creating a pull request?
Pushing code adds changes to local branch, while pull request merges changes from the local branch to the master (or other selected).

How does the apify push command work? Is it worth using, in your opinion?
This command uploads project to the Apify cloud and builds an actor from it. This is useful when development is done without using repositories (locally).
